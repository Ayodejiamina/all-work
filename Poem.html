<pre style="font-family:serif"><strong>At the beginning,there was a huge drop of Milk.
    Then Doondari came and he created the stone.
    Then the stone created iron;
    And iron created fire;
    And fire created water;
    And water created air.
    The Doondari descended the second time.
    And he took the five elements
    And he shaped them into man.
    But man was proud.
    Then doondari created blindness and blindness defeated man.
    Doondari created sleep,sleep defeated blindness;
    But when sleep became too proud,
    Doondari created death,and death defeated worry.
    But the death was too proud,
    Doondari descended for the third time,
    And he came as Gueno,the eternal one
    And Gueno defeated death.
